## Browser Compatibility

I tested the site on different browsers Google Chrome, Edge and Mozilla.

The layout, the features as buttons, search bars, like, comment form, alerts are displayed correctly and are all working correctly. The site features are functioning as intended.  Images are displayed correctly.

| Browser       | Layout rendered as expected | Features and buttons work as expected | Images work as expected |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| Google Chrome | Yes                         | Yes                  | Yes                |
| Edge          | Yes                         | Yes                  | Yes                |
| Mozilla       | Yes                         | Yes                  | Yes                |
